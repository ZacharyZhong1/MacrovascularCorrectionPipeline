# Macrovascular Correction Pipeline
MRA-Informed Biophysical Simulation for Removing Macrovascular Effects from fMRI

This pipeline was developed for the following studies. Please read these papers—especially the first one—carefully before using the pipeline.

This toolbox has four subunits. Please run them follow the order.

## Vessel_Segmentation
This step segments the vasculature from TOF-MRA using the BrainCharter toolbox. Please cite the original study if you use this component.

extract_vessel.sh\
	- Function: Core vessel extraction function from the BrainCharter toolbox.

MRVExtract_Coronal.m / MRVExtract_Sagittal.m\
	- Function: Registers MRA to T1 space and executes the main loop that calls the primary bash script. (For our dataset, both coronal and sagittal scans were used to improve vascular completeness.)\
	- Input: ParticipantFolder.txt — a text file listing input file names, one per line.

MRV_Enhance.m\
	- Function: Combines segmented vascular maps from coronal and sagittal MRA scans. (Automatically processes all segmented files generated by the previous script.)

## Vessel_Seperation
This step primarily involves manually removing false-positive detections from the previous segmentation. Our approach trims all “vessels” in the middle, but you may use any method you prefer. But please follow the data structure in the code.

Separation.m
	-	Function: Removes unwanted segmented vessels based on provided coordinates.
	-	A while-loop with 'block' has been added to prevent accidental execution. Please remove it before running the code.

## Simulation
The key component of this pipeline simulates the BOLD signal using a biophysical model. This step is computationally intensive, depending on the spatial resolution of MRA, and is recommended to run with 200–500 GB of RAM.
Please run the following code in the specified order:
