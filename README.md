# Macrovascular Correction Pipeline
MRA-Informed Biophysical Simulation for Removing Macrovascular Effects from fMRI

This pipeline was developed for the following studies. Please read these papers—especially the first one—carefully before using the pipeline.

This toolbox has four subunits. Please run the following subunits in the specified order:

## Vessel_Segmentation
This step segments the vasculature from TOF-MRA using the BrainCharter toolbox. Please cite the original study if you use this component.

- extract_vessel.sh
	- Function: core vessel extraction function from the BrainCharter toolbox.

- MRVExtract_Coronal.m / MRVExtract_Sagittal.m
	- Function: registers MRA to T1 space and executes the main loop that calls the primary bash script. (For our dataset, both coronal and sagittal scans were used to improve vascular completeness.)\
	- Input: ParticipantFolder.txt — a text file listing input file names, one per line.

- MRV_Enhance.m
	- Function: combines segmented vascular maps from coronal and sagittal MRA scans. (Automatically processes all segmented files generated by the previous script.)

## Vessel_Seperation
This step primarily involves manually removing false-positive detections from the previous segmentation. Our approach trims all “vessels” in the middle, but you may use any method you prefer. But please follow the data structure in the code.

- Separation.m
	-	Function: removes unwanted segmented vessels based on provided coordinates.
	-	A while-loop with 'block' has been added to prevent accidental execution. Please remove it before running the code.

## Simulation
The key component of this pipeline simulates the BOLD signal using a biophysical model. This step is computationally intensive, depending on the spatial resolution of MRA, and is recommended to run with 200–500 GB of RAM.
Please run the following code in the specified order:

- ManualAlighment_Pipeline.m
  - Function: Use the shape of the brain to align T1 and BOLD space with AFNI 3dAutobox. Detailed method see ref 1.
  - Please double-check the quality of alignment and manually adjust if necessary.
    
- fBV_Pipeline.m
  - Function: downsample the segmented and separated blood vessels from T1 space to BOLD space to estimate the fractional blood volume (fBV). Detailed method see ref 1.
  - Please replace the fMRI folder indicated in the script with your own folder.
 
- Yv_Extractor.m
	- 	Function: extract the BOLD signal from the voxel with the highest fBV as a surrogate signal of oxygenation level (Yv) change.  Detailed methods are described in refs. 1 and 2.
	- 	Please replace the fMRI folder indicated in the script with your own folder.

- Simulation_Pipeline_Yv.m
	-	Function: Main code for simulating the local B0 inhomogeneity with the Fourier-based Kernel approach.
 	-	Please adjust the basic parameter part according to you need. The upsample factor will be the resolution upsamping factors to calculate the B0 offset, recommand at least 4.

- R1Decay.m/R2_Decay/R2P_Decay.m
	-	Function: Computed the T1, T2, and T2P related signal.
